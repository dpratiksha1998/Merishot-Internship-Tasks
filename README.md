# Certainly! Writing a program for text encryption and decryption involves utilizing cryptographic techniques to secure the information. Cryptography is essential for maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Below, I'll provide a general outline of how to implement text encryption and decryption in Python using the cryptography library, which is a popular and powerful library for this purpose.

# Install the Cryptography Library: Ensure you have the cryptography library installed in your Python environment.
# You can install it using pip: pip install cryptography

# Import Necessary Modules:Import the necessary classes and functions from the cryptography library.

# Generate or Load Keys:Generate or load a secret key for encryption and decryption. The key must be securely stored and protected.

# Encrypt the Text:Use the secret key to encrypt the plaintext message. The encryption process transforms the readable text into ciphertext.

# Decrypt the Text:Use the same secret key to decrypt the ciphertext back to the original plaintext.
